# Rocket api

**NOTE: the rocket library requires Rust nightly build**

You can have stable and nightly version both installed.

```bash
# install nightly version of rust
# default is still stable version
rustup install nightly

# define nightly to be used for this project
# from projectfolder
rustup override set nightly
```
