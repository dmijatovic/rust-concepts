  <h1>Actix todo api with GraphQL</h1>
  <p>
    This api is testbed for combining actix-web and juniper GraphQL library.
    I have tested performance of Hasura using autocannon load test. It showed
    fair performance but was at the bottom compared to other api's.
  </p>
  <p>
    I was qurious if GraphQL performance can be improved with Rust because Hasura
    is developed in Haskell. Hasura uses Postgres database too just as this testbed
    solution.
  </p>
  <p>
    During development I discovered that current juniper version does not support
    async/await. Therefore I used tokio to spawn new threads and handle async/await
    methods used with deadpool and tokio-postgres crate.

  <h3>GraphiQL</h3>
